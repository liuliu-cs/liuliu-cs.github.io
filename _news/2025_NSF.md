We are thrilled to announce that our group has been awarded the prestigious NSF CAREER award! This recognition highlights our research in advancing energy-efficient and scalable AI systems through algorithm-architecture co-design approaches. This achievement would not have been possible without the hard work of the students, the invaluable insights from collaborators, and the support from colleagues. 

We look forward to the exciting research, educational, and outreach opportunities this award will enable and are deeply grateful to the National Science Foundation for supporting our work. Stay tuned for updates as we continue to explore new frontiers in AI and computing!
